# OSDP.Net

[![Build Status](https://dev.azure.com/jonathanhorvath/OSDP.Net/_apis/build/status/bytedreamer.OSDP.Net?branchName=develop)](https://dev.azure.com/jonathanhorvath/OSDP.Net/_build/latest?definitionId=1&branchName=develop)
[![NuGet](https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/OSDP.Net.svg?style=flat)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/OSDP.Net/)

OSDP.Net is a .NET framework implementation of the Open Supervised Device Protocol (OSDP). 
This protocol has been adopted by the Security Industry Association (SIA) to standardize access control hardware communication. 
Further information can be found at [SIA OSDP Homepage](https://www.securityindustry.org/industry-standards/open-supervised-device-protocol/).

## Getting Started

The OSDP.Net library provides a Nuget package to quickly add OSDP capablitity to a .NET Framework or Core project. 
You can install it using the NuGet Package Console window:

```shell
PM> Install-Package OSDP.Net
``` 

A control panel can be created and started with a few lines. 
Be sure to register events before start the connection.

```c#
var panel = new ControlPanel();
panel.ConnectionStatusChanged += (sender, eventArgs) =>
{
    // NOTE: Avoid blocking the thread so the control panel can continue polling
    Task.Run(async () =>
    {
        // Handle connection change event
    });
};
Guid connectionId = panel.StartConnection(new SerialPortOsdpConnection(portName, baudRate));
```

Once the connection has started, add Peripheral Devices (PD).

```c#
panel.AddDevice(connectionId, address, useCrc, useSecureChannel, secureChannelKey);
```

The following code will install a PD with an unique Secure Channel key. The OSDP standard requires that setting the secure key can only occur while communications are secure.

```c#
panel.AddDevice(connectionId, address, useCrc, useSecureChannel); // connect using default SC key
bool successfulSet = await panel.EncryptionKeySet(connectionId, address, 
    new EncryptionKeyConfiguration(KeyType.SecureChannelBaseKey, uniqueKey));
```

The ControlPanel object can then be used to send command to the PD.

```c#
var returnReplyData = await panel.OutputControl(connectionId, address, new OutputControls(new[]
{
    new OutputControl(outputNumber, activate
        ? OutputControlCode.PermanentStateOnAbortTimedOperation
        : OutputControlCode.PermanentStateOffAbortTimedOperation, 0)
});
```

The reader number parameter found in some commands is used for devices with multiple readers attached. If the device has a single reader, a value of zero should be used.
```c#
byte defaultReaderNumber = 0;
bool success = await ReaderBuzzerControl(connectionId, address, 
    new ReaderBuzzerControl(defaultReaderNumber, ToneCode.Default, 2, 2, repeatNumber))
```

## Custom Communication Implementations

OSDP.Net is able to plugin different methods of communications beyond what is included with the default package. 
It simply requires the installation a new NuGet package. The code needs to be updated by using it's implementation of the IOsdpConnection interface when starting a connection for the ControlPanel.

  - Notes: Requires compilation of native libraries for non-Windows platforms

## Test Console

There is compiled version of the test console application for all the major platforms available for download. 
It has all the required assemblies included to run as a self containsed executable. 
The latest version of the package can be found at [https://www.z-bitco.com/downloads/OSDPTestConsole.zip](https://www.z-bitco.com/downloads/OSDPTestConsole.zip)

NOTE: First determine the COM port identifier of the 485 bus connected to the computer. 
This will need to be entered when starting the connection. 
Be sure to save configuration before exiting.

## Contributing

The current goal is to properly support all the commands and replies outlined the OSDP v2.2 standard. 
The document that outlines the specific of the standard can be found on the [SIA website](https://mysia.securityindustry.org/ProductCatalog/Product.aspx?ID=16773).
